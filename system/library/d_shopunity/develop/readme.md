#Shopunity Development
Shopunity helps you speed up your development process by implementing cool features such as Gulp, phpUnit, Roboto and more.

##phpUnit
- open terminal in folder system/library/d_shopunity/develop
- run in terminal `$ Composer install`

Verify that your terminal is using the same php and mysql version as your Webserver
- to check php run in terminal `$ which php`
- to check mysql run in terminal `$ which mysql`

If you are missing a mysql or have a different path for php, change the path by running the following comands:
- on Mac for MAMP for php 7.1.1 
`PATH="/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.1.1/bin:$PATH"`
